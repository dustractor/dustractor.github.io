if you are ever feeling un-inspired, just play some blues

    I    I    I    I
    IV   IV   I    I
    V    IV   I    I

or

    I   I   I   I
    I   I   I   I
    IV  IV  I   I
    V   IV  I   I

or even

    I IV I V

or just

    I   V

loop those chords in your daw and solo over it for a while
