<p>(A crazy dream I just woke up from.)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a dream that did this:</p>
<p><img src="binnedpolymaths7.html_files\images\Screenshot 2023-12-21 053011.png" alt="alt text">
The dream paused after &quot;the atrocities&quot; (which I&#39;ll get to later) and suddenly I&#39;m in a room with a tv set. I saw a the dream on a screen and when I looked at the bottom there was a time bar showing how much time was left.</p>
<p>&quot;TWO HOURS? Ahh, hell no! I aint watchin this shit for another two hours!&quot;</p>
<p>... and then I woke up.  So I guess I can say definitively that I don&#39;t know how it ends.</p>
<p>It mostly took place in a compound that looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="binnedpolymaths7.html_files\images\Screenshot 2023-12-21 051306.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>That&#39;s a building on the side of a mountain. The entrance is at the top.  There were laboratories and bedrooms.</p>
<p>To say it was a cult would be an understatement.  More like ten cults.  A cult-within-a-cult, all the way down.  The further down you went in the building, the more shit got fucked up.</p>
<p>The upper levels was just your average &quot;we work on top-secret technology&quot; type cult where some of the lab interns would occasionally go to their private living quarters and have sexy time.  If you made it into the inner circle, you could get invited to the lower levels where the sexy time was all the time, even in the laboratories.</p>
<p>The vibe was like one of those artsy sci-fi films from the 1960&#39;s.  Think Logan&#39;s Run meets Zardoz or something. All the interns wore single color leotards in various pastel shades such as salmon pink, olive drab, seafoam green, UPS brown, etc.  All the architecture was very &quot;Le Corbusier&quot;.</p>
<p>By the time I got down further down into the compound, I had been shown videos of important moments in the cult&#39;s history.  Events such as how they chose the location (it was where a plane crashed), how they stole some of the technology (by hijacking said plane in midair), and some of the experiments gone wrong.</p>
<p>One of the cult founders had tried to give himself a horse penis, but...
<img src="binnedpolymaths7.html_files\images\Screenshot 2023-12-21 060834.png" alt="alt text">
...things did not go as planned.</p>
<p>They kept him locked up in one of the labs and every time you walked down that hallway you could hear it snorting and braying in low, frustrated tones.</p>
<p>Aside from weird sex stuff, the three main themes that these various cult factions were into were body modification, immortality, and mind-control.  The body modification cult leader was a ten-foot tall nordic blond guy who was always chasing after this beautiful woman (leader of the sex cult) who wouldn&#39;t have him because she was in love with the mind-control cult leader -- a guy who looked like your stereotypical shaolin monk except he had a diamond shape burned into his forehead.  (All of the mind-control cult followers had diamond shapes burned into their foreheads.)  The immortality cult leader was an ugly-ass chuck norris lookalike who was the only one of the bunch who wore all black and he always hung out in the restrooms, standing on top of a toilet, preaching.</p>
<p>There were cameras everywhere and all of the labs had screens showing the main entrance and the hallways outside the lab so they could warn each other whenever rival cult members (or the authorities) were approaching.  Whenever that happened, they would hide in secret compartments in the walls.  I was in a lab when this happened and the cubby-hole wouldn&#39;t fit any more people so I just had to stand in the corner and be still when people came and searched the room. Luckily they didn&#39;t notice me.</p>
<h2 id="the-atrocities">The Atrocities</h2>
<p>The rivalry between the body modification guy and the mind control guy turned into all out warfare.  The body mod guy had built a machine that was like a room with a laser wall that he said you could walk through the wall and it would enhance all your abilities, but actually all it did was cut people in half.  He tricked the mind control monk guy into walking across the spot where the wall was and then he turned the laser on.  The monk wasn&#39;t standing fully across the line so all that happened was it chopped off about an inch from his forehead. You could see his brain.  The beautiful woman saw this and she ran to tell everybody.  So all three factions storm into the lab and push the body mod guy through the laser wall so he gets sliced into a million pieces.  The mind control guy was still alive and he picks up his forehead and goes to the nearest bathroom to find the immortality guy for help.  When that guy finds out what&#39;s going on he whips out a battle axe and starts killing all of the followers of the body modification cult, including the woman. They chase him back into the bathroom and hack him to pieces with his own axe.  I was hiding in one of the bathroom stalls and came out after almost everybody was dead.  I crawled around on my hands and knees and looked at all the dead people.  There was blood everywhere.</p>
<p>Then it just pauses and I&#39;m in a room with a TV set.</p>
